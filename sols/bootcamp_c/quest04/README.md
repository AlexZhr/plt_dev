## Task
I've created functions wich show diffenrence in beetween two integer parameters as an array, duplicate strings(implementaion of strdup()), separetely print each string item of an array, return array that shows length of an each string in an array, wich convert arrays to string with separator. Also I've wrote the function wich takes string parameters as moving commands(R-right, A-advance, L-left) of the "spaceship" and calculate a path(x, y) and direction(up, dowm, left, right), depending on command string.
