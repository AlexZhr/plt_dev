## Task
Task was to create html and css files that should display 3 rows: 1.header(100%) 2. main(50%), empty(25%), sidebar(25%). 3. footer(100%). It should be realized using the bootstrap grid system.

## Description
First of all I've used bootstrap stater template(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) in the file index.html. Then I've create container-fluid div for contane display a full width. Then created the class "row" with class col-12(full-width row) "header" with tags h1(header)&b(to make it bold). Then ceate class "raw" where was created col-6(50% of the row) with h1"main", col-3(25%) empty row, col-3(25%) "sidebar" row with h1"main" and for the last "row" with col-12 for "footer". Afterwards, I've set background colors for each of collumn of the grid and text align in the file style.css.
