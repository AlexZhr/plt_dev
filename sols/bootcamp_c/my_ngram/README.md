# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
Write a program my_ngram,that count the number of occurrences per character and create a makefile.

## Description
I created a main function that sends arguments (strings in an received array) that creates an array of 128 elements (corresponding to 128 ASCII characters) and fills that array with the number of each existing character from the received arguments in the corresponding cell(by searching every character in the args). It then sends the filled array to the print function, which prints the characters at the cell index (if i > 0) and fills the cells using a loop.

## Installation
It can be compiled and cleaned up using the "make" function by typing in the DoCode console "make (+RULE_NAME(function of the rules descript in the Makefile))"

## Usage
Compiled file could be used with help of the DoCode console by the way by entering "my_ngram "arg1" "arg2"... "argn".
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
