# Welcome to My Allocine
***

## Task
Task was to get more practice in work with multiple SQL tables and it was necessary to write the queries that are described in the requests names.

## Description
I watched videos - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YufocuHbYZo, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkJKzR_sClM, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeOJ0ZMUYw, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh_pvk48jHA, tutorials, manuals https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/, https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html and work on the solutions. Work was done on the downloaded data base "movies.db" that has multiple tables. It was tested with sqlite queries and platform test "gandalf" that compared output of requests with expected values.

## Installation
To work with project user should have sqlite3 installed.

## Usage
Go to the direction with data base movies.db, then run into the terminal "sqlite3 movies.db" and input requests values from my_allocine.rb.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
